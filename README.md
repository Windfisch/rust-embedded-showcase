## Submit your project

- Adds information about your project at the end of `data.yml`. The file
  contains comments that will help you fill in the information.

The resources team will review your submission and let you know if it has been
accepted or not. If it doesn't get accepted this time but meets the hard
requirements, we'll let you know how it can be improved so you can resubmit at a
later date.
